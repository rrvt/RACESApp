<h2>Starting</h2>
<p>
When the app starts it loads the last database file known to the app.  It then loads the drop down
list in the dialog box with the current members information, sorted by name/call sign.  At that point
a member may be selected from the list or a search (find) may be used to display the fields of a single member.  Alternately, one of the commands will load former memembers information into the drop down list.
Then only former members may be displayed in the dialog box.
</p>
<p>
Making changes in the database is challenging.  Make the wrong change and the database loses some of its
purpose.  So, the app is designed to make making changes inadvertently difficult.  The status bar at the
bottom of the screen shows the current mode of operation (Read Only or Save Record Changes).  The inital
mode of operation is Read Only.  But Save Record Changes mode only
allows the app to save record changes to the app's version of the database.  
In order to change the actual file 
which contains the database, the Update and Exit command must be executed and the dialog question 
responded to in the afirmative.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/AccessIcon.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Load Database</h3>
<p>
The database is an .accdb file. A Open File dialog box starts and the user selects the correct file.  The file is
loaded into the app and the Drop Down List is loaded with current members.  At that point the records are read only
and the status bar describes the path and the content of the drop down list of members.
</p>


<h3><img src="Images/NewFile.jpg" width="15" height="14"> Create New Member</h3>
<p>
The drop down list is cleared, the fields are cleared and those fields with an explanation have labels stored in 
them.  Labels are distintuished from data by angle bracket, "&lt;label&gt;".  The mode is changed to Save Records (in liu
of Read Only).  Filling in the fields is only the first step.  Then the records need to be saved which happens 
automatically when any other action is executed.  Then the update and exit command needs to be executed with an 
affirmative response to the update question.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/People.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Load Current Members</h3>
<p>
Clear the drop down list and load the current members.  Reset the status to reflect the new list.
</p>


<h3><img src="Images/ExIcon.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Load Former Members</h3>
<p>
Clear the drop down list and load the former members.  Reset the status to reflect the new list.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Edit.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Edit Records</h3>
<p>
Change the mode from Read Only to Save Records.  There is no command to simply return to Read Only mode.
</p>


<h3><img src="Images/CheckLlist.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Open Member's Check List</h3>
<p>
Opens a dialog box for the member displayed that has a check list of all the things that should be done for
a new member (or maybe a member being transferred to the former member status).  The results of the check list are kept in the ini file.

<h3><img src="Images/Refresh.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Remove Database Dead Records</h3>
<p>
Each member record contains identifiers (integers) of Entitiy records.  Each Entity Record contains two
indentifiers (for an address and city record).  When a member record is deleted up to nine records may have been
orphaned.  However, some of them may be used in other member or entity records and cannot be deleted.  This command 
verifies every record is used somewhere otherwise it is marked to be deleted.
